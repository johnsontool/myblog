Extracting audio from multiple video files can be tedious if you do it manually one by one. Whether you’re archiving lectures, creating a music playlist from video files, or just need to separate soundtracks from MP4 videos, automation can save a lot of time.
In this guide, you’ll learn how to **batch extract MP3 files from MP4 videos** using **FFmpeg** and a short **Windows batch script**—no manual conversion required.

## Tools

* **FFmpeg** – a free, powerful command-line tool for audio and video processing
* **Windows Batch Script** – to automate repetitive FFmpeg commands

---

## Steps

1. **Install FFmpeg (Windows version)**

   * Download the official FFmpeg build from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
   * Add the `ffmpeg.exe` path to your Windows environment variables, or place it in the same directory as your videos.

2. **Create a Batch Script**

   * Open Notepad and paste the following script:

     ```bash
     @echo off
     for %%a in (*.mp4) do (
         ffmpeg -i "%%a" -vn -acodec libmp3lame -qscale:a 0 "%%~na.mp3"
     )
     ```
   * Save the file as `extract_mp3.bat` in the same folder as your MP4 videos.

3. **Run the Script**

   * Double-click the `.bat` file.
   * The script will loop through all `.mp4` files and extract their audio as `.mp3` in the same directory.

---

## How It Works

* **@echo off** — Suppresses command output in the terminal window.
* **for %%a in (*.mp4)** — Loops through every MP4 file in the current folder.
* **ffmpeg -i "%%a"** — Specifies the input video file.
* **-vn** — Excludes video output (audio only).
* **-acodec libmp3lame** — Uses the LAME MP3 encoder.
* **-qscale:a 0** — Sets the best audio quality (0 = highest).
* **"%%~na.mp3"** — Names the output file after the original video, changing only the extension.

---

## Notes

* You can adjust `-qscale:a` to balance file size and quality (e.g., `2` for medium quality).
* For other audio formats (like `.wav` or `.aac`), simply replace the codec and file extension.
* FFmpeg must be properly installed or located in the same directory for the script to run.

This simple workflow automates what would otherwise be a repetitive task. With FFmpeg and a batch file, you can convert entire folders of MP4 videos into MP3s in seconds — ideal for podcasting, music archiving, or quick audio extraction.
