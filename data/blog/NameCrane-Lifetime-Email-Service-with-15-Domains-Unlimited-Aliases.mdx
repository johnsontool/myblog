NameCrane is an independent brand under BuyVM that specializes in domain registration and email services. I recently came across their lifetime email service that costs just $75, which is incredibly competitive pricing-wise. If you're in the market for a reliable yet budget-friendly domain email solution, NameCrane is definitely worth checking out.

### Signing Up for NameCrane

NameCrane doesn't support direct registration - you need to purchase a service first to complete the registration process.

```bash
NameCrane domain email purchase link: https://namecrane.com/r/276/email
```

During registration, keep these important points in mind:
- Avoid using VPN during registration
- Use real information for name, country, and address
- Email verification is required before you can use your account normally

You can choose between US and European regions for your email service. I'd recommend going with the region closest to where your servers are located for the best performance. For example, if most of your setup is US-based, the US region will give you better speeds and response times.

### Step-by-Step Setup Guide

Let me walk you through the complete setup process. First, you'll need to add a domain to your NameCrane account. For example, I'll use johnstool.net:

![image-20251031204037497](static/images/image-20251031204037497.png)

Keep the other settings as default and click Submit to proceed. After submitting, make sure to save your initial login name and password from the administrator details:

Up next, you'll need to verify your domain ownership by adding the TXT record shown below to your domain registrar's DNS settings. This step is essential - it proves you actually own the domain:

Besides the TXT record, you'll also need to add these additional records to your domain's DNS configuration. These are crucial for getting your email routing to work properly:

Once you've set up all the DNS records, give it about 2-3 minutes for the changes to propagate. After that, you can access your email dashboard at `https://mail.yourdomain` to log in. Here's my setup URL:
```bash
https://mail.johnstool.net
```

Log in with the admin credentials from your Administrator Login Details. Once you're in as admin, you can set up new email addresses. For instance, I created contact@johnstool.net. You can then use this email address to log in and start sending and receiving messages.

Ready to test it out? Head over to **https://mail.johnstool.net** and log in with your new email address (contact@johnstool.net in my case). Once you're in, just hit "New" to compose and send your first test email.
