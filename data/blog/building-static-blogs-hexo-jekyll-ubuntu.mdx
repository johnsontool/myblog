A static blog refers to a blog website with only static resources, including HTML, images, etc., without databases or PHP dynamic languages.

Static blogs focus on: simplicity and speed. As long as you know how to use markdown notes, you can quickly build a personal blog using templates.

This article mainly introduces two frameworks for creating static blogs: Hexo and Jekyll:

- Hexo is developed based on Node.js, if you're familiar with JavaScript, you can quickly get started
- Jekyll is developed based on Ruby

Apart from the differences in development languages, their usage habits and community resources are similar. It's recommended to choose based on your familiarity with programming languages.

## Hexo Installation and Usage

### 1. Install Node.js

Visit the Node.js official website [Node.js — Download Node.js® (nodejs.org)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

First install nvm, then use it to install Node.js:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```

After successful installation, use nvm to install Node.js version v18.19.1:

```bash
nvm install 18
## Output version number to check if installation is successful
node -v
npm -v
```

The above node is the main program of Node.js, and npm is its package management tool, similar to the role of apt in Ubuntu. However, apt is used to download, install, and manage applications under Ubuntu, while npm is used to download, install, and manage libraries in Node.js.

### 2. Install Hexo and Use It

```bash
### Install hexo scaffold command
npm install -g hexo-cli
### Hexo project initialization
hexo init
### Create new blog post
hexo new "Article Title"
### Compile blog posts into HTML output files
hexo generate
### Start hexo built-in server to view effects
hexo server
```

After starting the hexo built-in service, you can view the website effect at http://localhost:4000/.

### 3. Hexo Blog Templates

On the official website [Themes | Hexo](https://hexo.io/themes/), you can see various templates. Choose your favorite template and download it to the themes/ directory of your current Hexo project. Then specify the template name to use in Hexo's configuration file _config.yml, for example, using the aircloud template:

```bash
theme: aircloud
```

After completing the template settings, your blog will present the corresponding visual effects, which is very convenient.

### 4. Using Hexo on Ubuntu

After using the "hexo generate" command, an export folder /public/ will be generated under the Hexo project file, which contains HTML folders converted from markdown format. Import the entire public directory to Ubuntu's /var/www/ directory using git commands, then configure the Nginx server on Ubuntu to use the public directory as the site's root directory.

## Jekyll Installation and Usage

Jekyll is a static website generator that converts plain text into static websites and blogs, such as converting your markdown notes into blogs. One of the main benefits of using Jekyll is that since it generates static websites, no databases or other backend components are needed, making websites easier to deploy and maintain.

To download and install the latest version of Ruby, we use rvm to install Ruby instead of Ubuntu's default apt command.

Steps: First install rvm, use rvm to install ruby, then use gem to install jekyll and bundler.

### 1. Install rvm

```bash
curl -sSL https://rvm.io/mpapis.asc | gpg --import -
curl -sSL https://rvm.io/pkuczynski.asc | gpg --import -
```

Download rvm installation package:

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
```

Make the terminal effective:

```bash
source /home/tfzhang/.rvm/scripts/rvm
```

Note that the above home directory needs to be adjusted according to your own system directory.

### Install the latest version of Ruby

Install ruby:

```bash
rvm install ruby
```

After installation, check if ruby and rubygems are correctly installed:

```bash
ruby -v
gem -v
```

If version numbers are output, the installation is successful.

Install jekyll and bundler:

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```

After successful installation, create a new jekyll site:

```bash
jekyll new my-new-site
```

Enter the newly created my-new-site, then start the jekyll server:

```bash
cd my-new-site && jekyll serve
```

When running the server, you might get an error:

```bash
could not find gem 'minima (~>2.5) in locally installed gems.'
```

You need to install minima:

```bash
gem install minima
```

After installation is complete, run: `jekyll server`

This will start a development server serving your site on a port of your local host (usually http://localhost:4000/). Now you can visit this address through your browser to view your site.
