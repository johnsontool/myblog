When you register a domain, you usually want an email address with that domain suffix to send and receive professional-looking emails.

As an example, I'll use my domain registered on Cloudflare to demonstrate how to set up an email service like contact@johnstool.net using Cloudflare + Brevo + Gmail.

The email service includes both receiving and sending functionality. For receiving emails, you can use Cloudflare's free email routing service, which forwards all emails sent to contact@johnstool.net to my Gmail address.

### Step-by-Step Setup for Incoming Mail

1. Log in to **Cloudflare Dashboard** → Email → *Email Routing*

2. Add a rule to configure a custom address (in my case, "contact@johnstool.net") and set the destination mailbox (for example, my Gmail).

```text
contact@johntool.net → mygmail@gmail.com
```

3. Verify your destination address.

4. Configure your DNS: You'll need to add a combination of MX and TXT records to your DNS for Email Routing to function properly.

5. Test by sending an email to `contact@johnstool.net` — it should land in your Gmail inbox.

### Step-by-Step Setup for Outgoing Mail

Since Cloudflare can only forward emails but can't send them actively, you'll need a third-party mail service like [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/).

1. Go to [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/) → sign up (free plan = 300 emails/day). Verify your email and phone number.

2. In Brevo Dashboard → **Senders & IPs** → **Domains** → Add Domain, then choose to authenticate the domain yourself.

```text
johnstool.net
```

<img src="/static/images/image-20251029100918166.png" alt="image-20251029100918166" style={{ zoom: "80%" }} />

<img src="/static/images/image-20251029101054318.png" alt="image-20251029101054318" style={{ zoom: "50%" }} />

3. Brevo will provide you with **DNS records** (Brevo code, DKIM1, DKIM2, and DMARC).

- Add these records in Cloudflare DNS. (Don't turn on proxy status for DKIM1 and DKIM2)
- Once you've added all the records, click "Authenticate this email domain" in Brevo. It takes seconds to verify if everything is configured correctly.

### Step-by-Step Configure Gmail "Send as"

1. Open **Gmail** → **Settings** → See all settings, go to **Accounts and Import** tab, under *Send mail as*, click **Add another email address**,

<img src="/static/images/image-20251029103311470.png" alt="image-20251029103311470" style={{ zoom: "50%" }} />

then enter (in my case):

- Name: johnson
- Email: `contact@johnstool.net`
- Uncheck *Treat as alias* if you want to keep Gmail and support mail separate.

SMTP Settings (you can get this information from *Brevo → Settings → SMTP & API*):

<img src="/static/images/image-20251029104810819.png" alt="image-20251029104810819" style={{ zoom: "50%" }} />

Gmail will send a verification code to `contact@johnstool.net`.

- Thanks to Cloudflare routing, it lands in your Gmail inbox.
- Click the link and confirm.

2. Now open Gmail, go to **Compose**, choose `From:contact@johnstool.net` and send to another email address. After sending the email, check the recipient's inbox - it should show as coming from your domain, without "via Gmail" notation.

### Conclusion

All **incoming mail** → Cloudflare forwards to Gmail.

All **outgoing mail** → Gmail uses Brevo SMTP, authenticated with SPF/DKIM.

The limitation of this setup is that Brevo has a daily sending limit. The free plan only allows 300 emails per day. If you need more, you can upgrade to other plans:

If your domain is not hosted on Cloudflare, you can check if your domain registrar provides email forwarding services. If they do, you can use them directly; if not, you might consider migrating your domain to Cloudflare.
